# CS3200 Starter App
Hi class! As some of you have noticed, the hardest thing we might do all semester is actually get these applications setup. While it is important to know how to set one up, from now on you can just use this one as a starting point. This starter app gives you the following things right out of the box:

1. A phone app
2. A watch app
3. An API module
4. Dependencies for Firebase, Databinding, and LifeCylce
5. Any code we write in class that is generally reusable.

## Setup
To get starting doing development you need follow these steps:

1. Download the starter code.
2. Rename the Modules to be something appropriate for the project.
3. Change the package name for each project
4. Create a project in firebase
5. Create 2 apps in Firebase, one for the Phone App and another for the Watch App
6. Download the google-services.json files for each app and put the in the proper place.
7. Run each app and make sure they launch. (If you didn't do step 6 correctly you will get an error)

Thats it, all of the dependencies are already added and linked for you!
